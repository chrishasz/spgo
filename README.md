### Configuration and Getting Started

To get started using SPGo, press `Ctrl+Shift+p` (Windows) `Cmd+Shift+p` (Mac) or open the Command Pallet and type `>SPGo: Configure Workspace` to bring up the SPGo Configuration Wizard. Upon successful configuration, a new file will be created in the root of your project folder called `spgo.json`. From there, all files and folders created under the `src` folder in your local workspace will be deployed to their corresponding site-relative path your SharePoint site upon save.

### SPGo.json Configuration Files

If configuration was successful, you should see a file similar to below:

```json
{
    "sourceDirectory": "src",
    "sharePointSiteUrl": "https://tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/MyProject",
    "publishingScope": "SaveOnly",
}
```

### Additional Configuration Options

#### Glob support for Publishing Workspace

Entering a [Glob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) pattern into a node called `publishWorkspaceGlobPattern` will cause SPGo to publish only files which match this glob pattern. For example, if you use another VSCode plugin to minify files on save, you can configure the `>SPGo: Publish local workspace` command to publish all minified files in the workspace with the format `<file>.min.<ext>` by setting the  `publishWorkspaceGlobPattern` property to `/**/*.min.*`.

#### Populating Remote Files

When you specify an array of remote folders in a node called `remoteFolders`, SPGo will recursively download the remote folder contents to your local workspace when you issue the Synchronize Files command `>SPGo: Populate Workspace`. Note: This **WILL** overwrite all local files.

#### Example Config json

```json
{
    "checkInMessage" : "Your custom Check-in message here",
    "sourceDirectory": "src",
    "sharePointSiteUrl": "https://tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/MyProject",
    "publishingScope": "SaveOnly",
    "publishWorkspaceGlobPattern": "/**/*.min.*",
    "remoteFolders": [
        "/SiteAssets/**/*",
        "/_catalogs/wp/",
        "/_catalogs/masterpage/"
    ]
}
```

### Use

SPGo will automatically launch when you run the Configure Workspace command `>SPGo: Configure workspace` or any time the SPGO Configuration file `spgo.json` is detected in the root of the current workspace.

### Security and Authentication Support

Credentials are stored in VSCode memory only. SPGo will only ask you for credentials the first time you sync with SharePoint each session. SPGo currently supports the following authentication modes:

* Digest (Office365)
* NTLM v1 (most on-premise installations)
* NTLM v1 + wwwAuth
* NTLM v2
* ADFS

    _A note for ADFS Authentication:_ You will need to add the following JSON node to the root of your your SPGo.json file:

    ``` json
    "authenticationDetails": {
        "relyingParty": "[relying party]",
        "adfsUrl": "[ADFS Url]"
    }
    ```
