## Command Name

`SPGo: Publish a minor version of the current file`

## Description

Publish a minor version of the current file to SharePoint. This command will perform the following actions:

- Check to see if the file is checked out. If not, the current file will be checked out
- Prompt the user for a publishing message
- A minor version of the file will be published to the server, including the user-entered publishing message
- The current file check-out will be preserved

_note: A default publishing message can be set using the `checkInMessage` parameter defined in the `spgo.json` [configuration file](/spgo/general/config-options#checkInMessage)._

### Advanced Usage

You can publish an entire folder at once, by left-clicking on the folder in the Visual Studio Code Explorer window and executing the `SPGo: Publish a major version of the current file` command.
