## 1.4.0 - 2019-06-21
### Added

### Changed
- Increased the amount of data logged when an error or exception occurs.
### Fixed
- HTML escaped characters in filenames will now be handled properly. example: `Style%20Library` in the `remoteFolders` property will no longer cause a download error.
- [This error](https://github.com/chrishasz/spgo/issues/80) where I was not matching files against the proper root of a site. Also my first [Pull request](https://github.com/koltyakov/sppull/pull/31) to one of the OS packages I depend on to make SPGo work!

## 1.3.4 - 2018-11-27
### Fixed
- Resolved a security issue with dependencies of the [vscode@1.1.21](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2018/11/26/event-stream) package.

## 1.3.3 - 2018-10-30
### Added
- Running any SPGo-based command will now activate SPGo, or prompt you to configure a local workspace if no `spgo.json` config file is present. Great UX enhancement idea via email request.
### Fixed
- [This Issue](https://github.com/chrishasz/spgo/issues/64) where SPGo *did not* consistently apply the correct auth headers for NTLM + www Auth, which *did* consistently annoying users.
- [This Other Issue](https://github.com/chrishasz/spgo/issues/63) where SPGo was unable to download files outside of folders. Really I didn't do much outside of type "npm update", as the heavy lifting was done by [@koltyakov](https://github.com/koltyakov). THANKS!
- [This Other, Other, Issue](https://github.com/chrishasz/spgo/issues/60) where json files without json extensions did not properly download. Again, thanks to [@koltyakov](https://github.com/koltyakov) for providing a fix via his great [sppull](https://github.com/koltyakov/sppull) library!

## 1.3.2 - 2018-8-11
### Added
- Support for NTLM v2 authentication, via [node-sp-auth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sp-auth/v/2.5.5) package upgrade
### Fixed
- Resolved an issue with file names in packaging. strictly cased file systems should be able to run SPGo without issue.

## 1.3.1 - 2018-6-7
### Added
- Integrated [cpass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cpass), allowing users to store credentials for each SharePoint site, removing the need to always reenter creds when launching SPGo. [Issue 47](https://github.com/chrishasz/spgo/issues/47)
### Changed
- The `SPGo> Publish a major version of the current file` and `SPGo> Publish a major version of the current file` commands now works at the folder level. All other context menu items will gracefully fail with a message that they do not yet support operations at the folder-level.
### Fixed
- Found/fixed another Glob issue, related to globstar searches (e.g. `/directory/**/*.*`), hopefully resolving all cases of [Issue 46](https://github.com/chrishasz/spgo/issues/46)
- Better URL concatenation prevents double-slashes when setting a SharePoint site URL ending in a slash, which resolves [Issue 50](https://github.com/chrishasz/spgo/issues/50)

## 1.3.0 - 2018-6-1
### Added
- Delete files from SharePoint (plus your local file system) using the `SPGo: Publish local workspace` command.
    - Inspiration: [this issue](https://github.com/chrishasz/spgo/issues/44) from GitHub.
### Fixed
- [This Issue](https://github.com/chrishasz/spgo/issues/46) opened a number of Glob->Caml related issues. I've resolved as many of them as I could find.
- Continued Improving Unix/Linux support for SPGo. Authoring SP customizations from Ubuntu; what a world we live in!

## 1.2.7 - 2018-5-18
### Fixed
- Unix-related Issues.

## 1.2.6 - 2018-5-18
### Fixed
- A packaging issue which prevented dependencies from being resolved.

## 1.2.5 - 2018-5-17
### Added
- Unix support! Resolved [This Request](https://github.com/chrishasz/spgo/issues/42) for Ubuntu support. OK, it sorta sounds like a bug, but really this is the first time I've tried building SharePoint solutions in a Unix environment.
### Changed
- Better warnings/errors for bad passwords and checked-out files.

## 1.2.4 - 2018-5-10
### Added
- [This request from Github](https://github.com/chrishasz/spgo/issues/35) will now allow you to specify a default check-in message using the `checkInMessage` config property in `SPGo.json`
- [This other request from Github](https://github.com/chrishasz/spgo/issues/34) will now allow you to manually reload config data from `SPGo.json` using the command `SPGO> Reload Configuration` or the shortcut `<alt> + r, <alt> + c`
### Fixed
- An issue where [Git integration caused unnecessary error messages in the SPGo output file](https://github.com/chrishasz/spgo/issues/34)
- You will now be prompted to enter a check-in message when you set "Publish a Major|Minor" Version" as your default save action.
- Refactored our core promise chain to properly, and most-importantly: DRY-ly, handle errors. Errors should consistently log and the progress bar will once again cease its endless spinning.

## 1.2.3 - 2018-4-14
### Added
- Glob support for retrieving files (e.g. /SiteAssets/*.*, /SiteAssets/*.css)

## 1.2.2 - 2018-2-28
### Fixed
- Resolved the final dependency issue, [#27](https://github.com/chrishasz/spgo/issues/27) & [#30](https://github.com/chrishasz/spgo/issues/30), preventing SPGo from loading. Root cause was an issue with NPM resolving dependencies.

## 1.2.1 - 2018-2-26
### Added
- SPGo now supports Germany, China, and the US Government's private Office 365 deployments! Not so private now, huh?!?
### Fixed
- Resolved a visual issue where a glob pattern matching 0 items would cause the progress spinner to spin endlessly.
- Resolved a number of dependency errors and version incompatibilities between SPGo, TypeScript, VSCode and various Typings.

## 1.2.0 - 2018-2-23
### Added
- Glob file management for uploads using the `SPGo: Publish local workspace` command.
    - Inspiration: [this issue](https://github.com/chrishasz/spgo/issues/24) from GitHub.
- Unit Tests! They're all the rage these days.
### Changed
- By Popular demand, all folders specified in the `remoteFolders` configuration property now respect glob formatting. If you want to download a folder and all subfolders, make sure to append `**/*.*` to all existing folder entries.
- Note: Glob support is ongoing development. File masking for remote file download is still in development.
### Fixed
- Security issue with dependency: `marked`

### Added
- Custom commit messages for publishing files and workspace.
### Changed
- Cleaned up Changelog + Readme visual layouts.

## 1.0.1 - 2018-1-3
### Fixed
- [This issue from Github](https://github.com/chrishasz/spgo/issues/19) which prevented file synchronization on save when users selected "SaveOnly" as the publishing scope.


## 1.0 - 2017-12-31
### Added
- Integrated VSCode's file comparison tools. File compare can now be used:
    - via the treeview context menu - right click on a file and compare to server.
    - when checking out a file - if the current server version and your local copy of a file are different, you will be prompted to view both files in a compare window.
- Refactored File Check in/out: Now you can manage binary files as well as text files through SPGo.
### Changed
- Reduced memory pressure with File checkout.
- Refactored Http error handling to provide a consistent user experience and DRY up a bunch of code. I'm only 80% happy with the current system, so expect more updates here in the future.
### Fixed
- Random testing showed that a publishing type of `None` failed in keeping its promise to not upload your file.

- Resolved [This other issue from Github](https://github.com/chrishasz/spgo/issues/10) - Authentication issues when using Multi Auth Site (NTLM + Forms).
- Resolved [This other, other issue from Github](https://github.com/chrishasz/spgo/issues/9) - When an error or cancellation causes an empty SPGo.json file to be created, SPGo will now properly recreate the json config on a subsequent use of the `>SPGo: Configure Workspace` command.
